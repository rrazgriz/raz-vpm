This repository hosts my [VPM](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/vpm/)-Compatible packages for use with the [VRChat Creator Companion](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/).

## Usage With VCC
### Adding Repo Listing
- With the [latest VCC installed](https://vrchat.com/download/vcc), just go to https://vpm.razgriz.one/, click `Add to VCC` at the top, and follow the prompts!
- Otherwise, make sure you have the [VPM CLI](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/vpm/cli) installed, then run the command `vpm add repo https://vpm.razgriz.one/index.json`.

### Adding Packages to a Project

In the VPM Interface, select your project, locate the `Selected Repos` dropdown, and check `Raz's VPM Repo`. Then, select the package you want to add, and click the plus button.

## Manual Usage

Each package has its own repository, and usually contains a standalone package distribution, as well as a VPM-compatible package distribution. If you want to use the standalone package, you can download it from the releases page of the package's repository.
